Webhooks allow you to build or set up apps which subscribe to certain events on the RiskLimiter Inspection Suite. When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL.

Each webhook can be installed on an organization or specific RiskLimiter Report. Once installed, they will be triggered each time one or more subscribed events occur on that organization or Report.


You can create up to 5 webhooks for each event on each installation target (specific organization or specific Report).
